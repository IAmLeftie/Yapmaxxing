Makes player characters vocalize when talking in General chat. Additionally understands context for greetings, goodbyes, laughter, pain, or whether a message is short or long.

Fully configurable so that players can choose their own word lists for activating special contexts, as well as an option to ignore messages entirely enclosed in parentheses, for use with proximity chat mods for RP OOC purposes!
